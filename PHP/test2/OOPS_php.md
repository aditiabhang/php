-PHP Classes
>In PHP, a class can include member variables called properties for defining the features of an object, and functions, called methods, for defining the behavior of an object. A class definition begins with the keyword class, followed by a class name. Curly braces enclose the definitions of the properties and methods belonging to the class.
For example:

>     class Person {
>     public $age; //property
>     public function speak() { //method
>     echo "Hi!"
>     }
>     }
The code above defines a Person class that includes an age property and a speak() method.
A valid class name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores.
>
>Notice the keyword **public** in front of the speak method; it is a *visibility specifier*.
The **public** keyword specifies that the member can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
There are other visibility keywords and we will learn about them in later lessons.

----------------------------------------------------------
-PHP Objects
>The process of creating an object of a class is called instantiation.
To instantiate an object of a class, use the keyword new, as in the example below:

>     $bob = new Person();

>In the code above, $bob is an object of the Person class.
>
>To access the properties and methods of an object, use the **arrow (->)** construct, as in:
echo **$bob->age**;
>
>This statement outputs the value of the age property for $bob. If you want to assign a value to a property use the assignment operator = as you would with any variable.
>
>Let's define the Person class, instantiate an object, make an assignment, and call the speak() method:

>     class Person {
>     public $age;
>     function speak() {
          echo "Hi!";
>       }
>     }
>     $p1 = new Person(); //instantiate an object
>     $p1->age = 23; // assignment
>     echo $p1->age; // 23
>     $p1->speak(); // Hi!
-----------------------------------------------------------
-$this
>**$this** is a pseudo-variable that is a reference to the calling object. When working within a method, use $this in the same way you would use an object name outside the class.
For example:
>
>     class Dog {
>     public $legs=4;
>       public function display() {
>         echo $this->legs;
>       }
>     }
>     $d1 = new Dog();
>     $d1->display(); //4
>
>     $d2 = new Dog();
>     $d2->legs = 2;
>     $d2->display(); //2
We created two objects of the Dog class and called their display() methods. Because the display() method uses $this, the legs value referred to the appropriate calling objectâ€™s property value.
As you can see, each object can have its own values for the properties of the class.

-----------------------------------------------------------
- PHP Class Constructor
>PHP provides the constructor magic method _ _ construct(), which is called automatically whenever a new object is instantiated.
For example:
>     class Person {
>     public function _ _ construct() {
>       echo "Object created";
>       }
>     }
>     $p = new Person();
The _ _ construct() method is often used for any initialization that the object may need before it is used. Parameters can be included in _ _ construct() to accept values when the object is created.
For example:
>     class Person {
>     public $name;
>     public $age;
>     public function _ _ construct($name, $age) {
>     $this->name = $name;
>     $this->age = $age;
>       }
>     }
>     $p = new Person("David", 42);
In the code above, the constructor uses arguments in the new statement to initialize corresponding class properties.
You can't write multiple _ _ construct() methods with different numbers of parameters. Different constructor behavior must be handled with logic within a single __ construct() method.
-----------------------------------------------------------
- PHP Class Destructor
>Similar to the class constructor, there is a destructor magic method _ _ destruct(), which is automatically called when an object is destroyed.
For example:
>     class Person {
>     public function __ destruct() {
>     echo "Object destroyed";
>       }
>     }
>     $p = new Person();
This script creates a new Person object. When the script ends the object is automatically destroyed, which calls the destructor and outputs the message "Object destroyed".
To explicitly trigger the destructor, you can destroy the object using the ***unset()*** function in a statement similar to: ***unset($p);***
>
>Destructors are useful for performing certain tasks when the object finishes its lifecycle. For example, release resources, write log files, close a database connection, and so on.
PHP releases all resources when a script finishes its execution.
----------------------------------------------------------
- PHP Class Inheritance
>Classes can inherit the methods and properties of another class. The class that inherits the methods and properties is called a subclass. The class a subclass inherits from is called the parent class.
>
>Inheritance is achieved using the **extends** keyword.
For example:
>     class Animal {
>     public $name;
>     public function hi() {
>     echo "Hi from Animal";
>       }
>     }
>     class Dog extends Animal {
>     }
>     $d = new Dog();
>     $d->hi();
Here the Dog class inherits from the Animal class. As you can see, all the properties and methods of Animal are accessible to Dog objects.
>
>Parent constructors are not called implicitly if the subclass defines a constructor. However, if the child does not define a constructor then it will be inherited from the parent class if it is not declared private.
Notice all our properties and methods have public visibility.
>
>For added control over objects, declare methods and properties using a visibility keyword. This controls how and from where properties and methods can be accessed.
Check out the next lesson for more on visibility.
----------------------------------------------------------
- PHP Visibility
>**Visibility** controls how and from where **properties** and **methods** can be accessed.
So far, we have used the **public** keyword to specify that a property/method is accessible from anywhere.
There are two more keywords to declare visibility:
>
>**protected**: Makes members accessible only within the class itself, by inheriting, and by parent classes.
>
>**private**: Makes members accessible only by the class that defines them.
>
>**Class properties must always have a visibility type**. Methods declared without any explicit visibility keyword are defined as public.
*Protected members are used with inheritance.
Private members are used only internally in a class.*
---------------------------------------------------------
- PHP Interfaces
>An **interface** specifies a <u>list of methods that a class **must** implement</u>. However, the interface itself does not contain any method implementations. This is an important aspect of interfaces because it allows a method to be handled differently in each class that uses the interface.
>
>The **interface** keyword defines an interface.
>
>The **implements** keyword is used in a class to implement an interface.
>
>For example, AnimalInterface is defined with a declaration for the makeSound() function, but it isn't implemented until it is used in a class:
>     <?php
>     interface AnimalInterface {
>     public function makeSound();
>     }
>
>     class Dog implements AnimalInterface {
>     public function makeSound() {
>     echo "Woof! <br />";
>       }
>     }
>
>     class Cat implements AnimalInterface {
>     public function makeSound() {
>     echo "Meow! <br />";
>       }
>     }
>
>     $myObj1 = new Dog();
>     $myObj1->makeSound();
>
>     $myObj2 = new Cat();
>     $myObj2->makeSound();
>     ?>
A class can implement multiple interfaces. *More than one interfaces can be specified by separating them with commas.* For example:
>
>     class Demo implements AInterface, BInterface, CInterface {
>     // Functions declared in interfaces must be defined here
>     }
NOTE:  An interface can be inherit another interface by using the extends keyword.
All the methods specified in an interface require public visibility.
------------------------------------------------------
- PHP Abstract Classes
>**Abstract classes** <u>can be inherited but they cannot be instantiated.</u>
They offer the advantage of being able to **contain both methods with definitions and abstract methods that aren't defined until they are inherited**.
>
>A class inheriting from an abstract class must implement all the abstract methods.
>
>The **abstract** keyword is used to create an abstract class or an abstract method.
For example:
>     <?php
>     abstract class Fruit {
>     private $color;
>    
>     abstract public function eat();
>    
>     public function setColor($c) {
>       $this->color = $c;
>       }
>     }
>
>     class Apple extends Fruit {
>       public function eat() {
>        echo "Omnomnom";
>      }
>     }
>
>     $obj = new Apple();
>     $obj->eat();
>     ?>
Abstract functions can **only** appear in an abstract class.
--------------------------------------------------
- The static Keyword
>The PHP **static** keyword <u>defines static properties and static methods</u>.
A static property/method of a class can be accessed without creating an object of that class.
>
>A static property or method is accessed by using the scope resolution operator  **::**   between the class name and the property/method name.
For example:
>     <?php
>     class myClass {
>     static $myStaticProperty = 42;
>     }
>
>     echo myClass::$myStaticProperty;
>     ?>
The **self** keyword is needed <u>to access a static property from a static method in a class definition.</u>
For example:
>     <?php
>     class myClass {
>     static $myProperty = 42;
>     static function myMethod() {
>       echo self::$myProperty;
>       }
>     }
>
>     myClass::myMethod();
>     ?>
NOTE: Objects of a class **cannot access static properties** in the class but they **can access static methods**.
-----------------------------------------------------
- The final Keyword
>The PHP **final** keyword defines methods that <u>cannot be overridden in child classes.</u> Classes that are defined final <u>cannot be inherited.</u>
>
>This example demonstrates that a final method cannot be overridden in a child class:
>     <?php
>     class myClass {
>     final function myFunction() {
>     echo "Parent";
>        }
>     }
>     // ERROR because a final method cannot be overridden in child classes.
>     class myClass2 extends myClass {
>       function myFunction() {
          echo "Child";
>        }
>     }
>     ?>
The following code demonstrates that a final class cannot be inherited:
>     <?php
>     final class myFinalClass {
>     }
>
>     // ERROR because a final class cannot be inherited.
>     class myClass extends myFinalClass {
>     }
>     ?>
NOTE: Unlike classes and methods, *properties cannot be marked finalTC.
